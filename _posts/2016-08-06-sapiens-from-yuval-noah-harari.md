## Favorite Quotes

"Is there anything more dangerous than dissatisfied and irresponsible gods \[Sapiens\] who don't know what they want?"

"Sapiens can cooperate in extremely flexible ways with countless numbers of strangers. That's why Sapiens rule the world, whereas ants eat our leftovers and chimps are locked up in zoos and research laboratories."

"We study history not to know the future but to widen our horizons, to understand that our present situation is neither natural nor inevitable, and that we consequently have many more possibilities before us than we imagine."
