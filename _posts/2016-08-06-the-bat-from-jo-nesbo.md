## Favorite Quotes

"Everything you do leaves traces, doesn't it. The life you've lived is written all over you, for those who can read."

"Intuition is just the sum of all your experience. The way I see it, everything you've experienced, everything you know, you think you know and didn't know you knew is there in your subconscious lying dormant, as it were. As a rule you don't notice the sleeping creature, it's just there, snoring and absorbing new things, right. But now and then it blinks, stretches and tells you, hey, I've seen this picture before. And tells you where in the picture things belong."

"People change. The person you long for may no longer exist. Bloody hell, we all change, don't we."
